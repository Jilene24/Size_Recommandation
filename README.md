This project utilizes a YOLOv8 model specifically designed for detecting oversized clothing items. The dataset was meticulously curated through web scraping, collecting images from various online sources to ensure a diverse representation of clothing styles. Each image was then manually annotated using Roboflow, categorizing the clothing into regular and oversized classes. This careful labeling process enhances the model's ability to accurately identify oversized garments, making it a valuable tool for applications in fashion retail and e-commerce, where understanding clothing sizes is crucial for customer satisfaction and reducing return rates. The project showcases the effective integration of advanced object detection techniques with practical data collection and annotation methodologies.
